# Machine Learning in Finance Course

Companion code and Jupyter notebooks for the Jors Academy course **Machine Learning in Finance: A Comprehensive Course**.

This repository focuses on practical, reproducible implementations of financial data processing, time-series analysis, machine learning, deep learning, portfolio management, risk management, algorithmic trading, NLP, and advanced financial applications.

## Important Methodology Notes

Financial machine learning is highly sensitive to data leakage and invalid validation procedures. The examples in this repository use chronological train/test splits where appropriate and avoid random shuffling for time-series forecasting tasks.

Whenever a target depends on future prices or returns, predictors are constructed only from information that would have been available at the prediction timestamp.

For cross-sectional credit-risk examples, preprocessing is fitted only on training data and out-of-time validation is preferred when the objective is to approximate future deployment conditions.

Portfolio clustering examples standardize heterogeneous K-Means features and use a proper correlation-distance representation for hierarchical clustering rather than treating correlation-matrix rows as ordinary Euclidean observations.

Algorithmic-trading examples explicitly lag positions when appropriate and include transaction-cost assumptions so that a same-period signal is not credited with returns that occurred before the signal could have been executed.

Financial NLP examples preserve source provenance and publication timestamps. Sentiment, entity extraction, and generative-model outputs are treated as intermediate features rather than assumed trading signals, and downstream strategies use delayed positions to avoid look-ahead bias.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The FinBERT example has optional dependencies that are not required by the rest of the repository:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```
